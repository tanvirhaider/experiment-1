      "p2": "Peru had endured a two-decade period through the 1980s and ‘90s plagued by terrorism, a struggling economy and low morale. Bombings, food shortages and power outages occurred on a regular basis.",

      "p1": "“People didn't love the identity of the Peruvians,” says the chef Palmiro Ocampo, 32, who grew up in Lima during those years, “because ‘Peruvian’ was terrorism. It was terror.”",
      "p2": "Today, Peru has risen from what many describe as “chaos” and, thanks to efforts of four generations of the country’s chefs, reimagined itself through a thriving gastronomical culture. Lima is now considered one of the world’s leading culinary destinations.",
      "p3": "Both Eulert, 34, and Ocampo, 32, are members of the self-proclaimed “Generacion con Causa” or “Generation with a Cause” — the fourth generation of contemporary Peruvian chefs. Their predecessors helped establish the country’s culinary reputation, one that has also been shaped by native cooking styles from the Peru’s longstanding European, African and Asian immigrant populations. Now the fourth generation are taking their crusade farther by capturing it in a literal <a href='http://peru.info/es-pe/generacionconcausa/manifiesto' target='_blank'>manifesto</a> first drafted by Ocampo.",
      "p4": "“We’re trying to use gastronomy as a social instrument,” says Ocampo, who studied medicine before switching to culinary school and training at internationally acclaimed restaurants like Noma in Denmark and El Celler de Can Roca in Spain.",
      "p5": "“Cooking is like a social cause,” agrees Eulert, who considered becoming a visual artist before committing to cooking: “We have the same mission: zero-waste kitchens, local ingredients.”",
      "p6": "In the seaside neighborhood of Miraflores, only minutes away from the 1992 location of the country’s worst terrorist bombing by the Communist group The Shining Path, Eulert serves a fine balance of global flavors and local ingredients, such as “Indo-China” scallops in a yellow-curry butter with quinoa and “Bombay” black spaghetti with shrimp, curry sauce and cashews. The seafood is never frozen — the scallops are delivered live, and the cocoa nibs and passion fruit are also sourced locally, benefits of the country’s being surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Andes and the Amazon.",

Her last stop is for a cocktail at El Mercado cevicheria, where she once worked under her longtime mentor, the acclaimed chef Rafael Osterling.",
      "p2": "Osterling, 47, is part of the second generation, many of whom were classically trained at schools and restaurants in Europe and the U.S. before returning to open their own restaurants in Peru.",
      "p3": "“People started loving this country when they started getting access to culture,” says Osterling, who speaks in British-inflected English. His private office above his bustling, airy seafood restaurant is filled with mid-century furniture and adjoined by a patio crowded with a lush assortment of tropical plants signaling a keen sense of design — one that pervades many of the city’s <span>contemporary eateries.</span>",

      "p5": "“The first generation were the first ones to honor Peruvian food,” says Osterling.",
      "p6": "“They built the conditions and the dream and the purpose and the meaning of what we did later,” says Gastón Acurio, 49, a second-generation chef and TV personality who opened his flagship Astrid y Gastón in 1994 and is considered a national hero in Peru. He goes down a list of revered first-generation chefs: Luis “Cucho” La Rosa. Humberto Sato. Isabel Alvarez. Teresa Izquierdo. Bernardo Roca Rey. “They were pioneers fighting for our dreams in much more difficult times,” he says.",

      "The early-generation chefs created “Novoandina” (or “New Andean”) cuisine, which fused European cooking techniques with indigenous products like quinoa, Andean potatoes and peppers. All have since gained global popularity, but three or four decades ago, shoppers at Lima’s central market in Surquillo, a regular destination for the city’s best chefs, wouldn’t have found them.",
      "“There were no products from the Amazon, almost no products from the Andes besides some potatoes,” says the third-generation chef Mitsuharu Tsumura, 35. His Miraflores restaurant, Maido, serves the Japanese-influenced Peruvian cuisine known as “nikkei” and is among three Lima restaurants on the 2017 World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. “Everything was from Lima. Even if you brought it, nobody would buy it.”",
      "At the same time, Acurio says that once the internet began connecting the world and diversity became “interesting” and “beautiful,” he and his peers began to question the contradictions and lack of opportunities for Peruvians."

      "“Gastón was very powerful in media so he could reach people,” says Tsumura, who considers Acurio one of his closest friends. “Gastón started to bring people, chefs, everybody who was involved in gastronomy together, and said, ‘Let’s investigate, let’s analyze what Peru really is,’ because we didn’t know. He made Peruvians fall in love again with their country.”",
      "Today, the Surquillo market welcomes visitors with an abundance of goods, from colorful piles of hot-pink spotted olluco potatoes and golden berries to multiple varieties of quinoa and chalky bags of coarse Maras salt sourced from Incan ponds in the Andean highlands.",
      "“The new Peruvian message of food is biodiversity and the unknown,” says the third-generation chef Virgilio Martínez, who helms renowned Central in Miraflores and serves a tasting menu featuring around 200 meticulously sourced local ingredients from 18 different altitudes. For the last several years, he and Central’s research group, Mater Iniciativa, have foraged for native ingredients and studied indigenous food systems in the Andes and the Amazon. Martínez has also invited young chefs from the fourth generation to join the expeditions. “If you cook with these ideas, this cuisine is way stronger than we think it is now — it’s not pisco sours, ceviches and great tasty food anymore. It’s another level.”"

      "Fourth-generation chef José Luján Vargas, 30, is doing just that with his three Cusco-based restaurants. “Cusco was the capital of the Incan Empire, which is the culture of our ancestors,” says Vargas, who trained under Acurio and considers him “a source of motivation in every aspect.”",
      "“For me it was very important to be able to fully penetrate and learn everything about our beginnings, touring every archaeological center, museums, fields of culture, libraries and communities, learning the processes, ancestral techniques, inputs, folklore, among others — the same ones that I present in my restaurants,” Vargas explains.",
      "While the previous generations paved the way, the Generation with a Cause hope to push their culinary creativity even farther. And yet, these younger chefs face new challenges.",
      "“It’s a kind of incoherence when you talk about fine-dining cuisine in Peru, which is a country [where] 43 percent of people have hunger,” says Ocampo, who recently launched a sophisticated tasting menu at his second-floor 1087 Restaurante in the upscale San Isidro  district comprised of “scraps”  — wilted rose petals that have been pickled, caramelized strawberry fronds and cocktails steeped with used coffee grounds. “As a cook, I feel that literally we have the responsibility in our hands. That’s the reason I use this concept of culinary recycling and optimal cuisine.”"

    "copy7": [
      "The same goes for the fourth-generation chef Matías Cillóniz, who trained under Martínez and cooked internationally in various hotel restaurants before opening the Mo Café and Bistró in the bohemian district of Barranco.",
      "“Now I’m way more conscious — socially and environmentally,” says Cillóniz, 31, who creates an artfully composed vegetable-forward menu that incorporates upcycled ingredients, such as banana peels turned into a rich, savory sauce.",
      "But even with the growing necessity of this brand of conscientious cooking, the chefs haven’t lost sight of the true nature of Peruvian cuisine. For Tsumura, it’s “sabrosa,” or tasty: “Peruvian cuisine is a slap in your face. When you eat Peruvian food, you’ll feel it.”"
